		// Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
		// You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).
		// You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).
		// As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
		// For you specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car.
